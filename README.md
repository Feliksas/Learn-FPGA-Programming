**Learn FPGA Programming, published by Packt**

## What is this book about?
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have now become a core part of most modern electronic and computer systems. However, to implement your ideas in the real world, you need to get your head around the FPGA architecture, its toolset, and critical design considerations. FPGA Programming for Beginners will help you bring your ideas to life by guiding you through the entire process of programming FPGAs and designing hardware circuits using SystemVerilog. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the FPGA architecture and its implementation
* Get to grips with writing SystemVerilog RTL
* Make FPGA projects using SystemVerilog programming
* Work with computer math basics, parallelism, and pipelining
* Explore the advanced topics of AXI and serial interfaces
* Discover how you can implement a VGA interface in your projects

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
always @(posedge CK) begin
 stage = D;
 Q = stage;
end
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This FPGA design book is for embedded system developers, engineers, and programmers who want to learn FPGA and SystemVerilog programming from scratch. FPGA designers looking to gain hands-on experience in working on real-world projects will also find this book useful.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
